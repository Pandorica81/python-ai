To activate a virtual environment (also known as a virtualenv or venv), you'll need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Create a new virtual environment**

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment. Run the following command:
```
python -m venv myenv
```
Replace `myenv` with the name you want to give your virtual environment.

**Step 2: Activate the virtual environment**

Once the virtual environment is created, you'll need to activate it. For Linux/MacOS, run:
```
source myenv/bin/activate
```
For Windows, run:
```
.\myenv\Scripts\activate
```
You should see a prompt indicating that you are now in your virtual environment:
```
(myenv) $
```
This indicates that all Python packages and modules installed within the virtual environment will not affect your system's Python installation.

**Step 3: Verify the virtual environment is active**

Run `python --version` to verify that you are indeed running the Python version specific to this virtual environment. You can also check the prompt again:
```
(myenv) $
```
If you want to exit the virtual environment and return to your system's Python installation, run:
```
deactivate
```

That's it! Your virtual environment is now active, allowing you to install packages and work on projects without affecting your system's Python installation.
